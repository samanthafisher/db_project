Senior database project - PHP Interface for PostgrSQL database

VTFlix, similar to Flixster.com, a movie ratings/social network system allows users to explore existing movie info and ratings, rate movies, and see ratings of friends.


Implemented in PHP and JavaScript:


Simple social network - users login to view/edit profile, view and send friend requests, and rate movies.

Movie info - title, director, year, rating, etc.

Sample queries - Which movies has Brad Pitt starred in?, 50 top-rated movies, etc.
